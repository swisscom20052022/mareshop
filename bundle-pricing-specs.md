## 2. Pricing Strategy Notes
- Keep savings in the 6–10% range (protects margin but motivates bundle vs single).
- Emphasize intangible value (pre-curated gift, matching colors, limited edition sets) to justify moderate discount.
- For sets crossing free shipping threshold, reinforce "Ships free" in bullets.

## 6. Operational Notes
- Inventory: Made-to-order simplifies stock risk; ensure time estimates reflect 2-item prep.
- Production Time Buffer: Add +1 business day to multi-item sets in listing to manage expectations.
- Packaging: Standardize insert card (thank you + QR to email signup + review prompt).

## 7. Success Metrics
- Bundle Adoption Rate: % of orders containing a bundle (Goal: 8–12% by Day 90).
- Incremental AOV Lift: AOV with bundles vs baseline single-item AOV.
- Margin Preservation: Maintain blended GM ≥60% for bundle orders.

## 8. Future Iterations
- Limited Edition Seasonal Bundle (Q4): Add seasonal colorway + exclusive packaging.
- 3-Pack Headband Value Set (spring/summer) for dreadlock / festival positioning.
- Upsell Add-On: "Add matching headband for €X" (cart remarketing / listing FAQ).

# Lifecycle Email Flow Specifications (Days 1â€“7)

Objective: Launch foundational flows to drive repeat purchases, UGC, and review velocity. Where Etsy direct email capture is constrained, leverage: (a) Packaging insert with QR to signup landing page (outside Etsy policies compliance); (b) Social bio links; (c) Post-purchase thank-you message requesting optional signup for care tips & early color drops.

ESP Options: MailerLite / Klaviyo (if standalone site planned) OR simple ConvertKit embedded form.

## Risk & Mitigation Summary
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Over-editing too many listings at once | Hard to attribute performance shifts | Wave approach + change log |
| Margin erosion via bundles | Lower gross margin | Keep discount <10% + verify COGS |
| Low email signup velocity | Slower repeat lift | Optimize insert value proposition (color drops) |
| Asset production bottleneck | Delayed CRO | Batch shoot + reusable template library |
| Inconsistent keyword usage | Lower SEO gains | Maintain keyword map & review new titles vs map weekly |
